# Mymmalloc - A general purpose dynamic memory allocation library

With this C library you will be able to use a statically allocated 'user defined' space of memory as a dynamic one. Library provides dynamic memory allocation routines for those memory spaces. 
User should statically allocate the space in memory and be shure to have the corresponding W/R acces.
For every different space of memory the user wants to dynamically interact with, a new mymalloc_handler handler should be declared and initialized to interact with te API.
